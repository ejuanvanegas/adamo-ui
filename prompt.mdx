Create the accordion stories.

Make sure to  refer to: 
- shadcn/ui docs: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion
- radix ui docs: https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion

Rules:
- Use the correct components and tailwind prefixed classes
- Do not add (args types)/controls, just the stories
- Use proper story name case, only first word capitalized (name: With icon), the component/(story itself) can be named normally (WithIcon)
- Do not import React directly, instead import what is needed, for example, useState instead of importing all React
- Add descriptions to all (args types)/controls and stories
- Render the component correctly in the stories using the render function
- Name the stories files in kebab-case
- Setup the component props using the args parameter in the story itself, and destructure the args in the render function, for example:

export const Default: Story = {
  args: { type: "single", collapsible: true },
  render: function Render(args) {
    return (
      <Accordion
        {...args}
        className={cn("adm:w-full")}
      >
      </Accordion>
    );
  },
};
